# osk8s
Sample solution for K8S hack

File setup.ps1 has all the steps you need to get through day one of the challenge.  

The parameters fro this powershell are:

* $clustername
* $clusterresourcegroup
* $k8sversion
* $clusterresourcegrouplocation
* $clusterstorageaccountname
* $sshkey

You can run the powershell as it stands or cherry pick commands you need to complete set-up of day 1 activities.

** It is powershell but its mainly Azure CLI and kubectl commands.  If running locally you will need to install these first.**
